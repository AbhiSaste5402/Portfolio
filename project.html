                            model that can accurately predict the selling price of houses.
                            <br>2. Accurate predictions can help homeowners and real estate agents determine the
                            optimal selling price for their properties, while also helping buyers
                            make informed decisions when purchasing a home.

                            <br>3. The project involves collecting and processing data on various features that
                            influence house prices, such as the number of bedrooms,
                            bathrooms, location, square footage, and age of the house.
                            <br>4. The collected data was pre-processed to remove any inconsistencies or outliers
                            and then used to train and test various machine learning models.
                            <br>5. This data was then trained on three different models, namely, Linear regression,
                            Lasso and Decision Tree Regressor to find out the highest accuracy
                            from all using the Grid Search method.
                            <br>6. From these three models Linear Regression model proved to be the highest accuracy
                            gainer with the total accuracy of
                            81.83% and thus was used for the training and the predictions.
