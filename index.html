                        <p><strong>Project Description:</strong><br>

                        The main objective of this project was to detect tuberculosis, pneumonia, and healthy and infected lungs from X-ray images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Three popular CNN architectures, VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50, were used for the detection task. <br>Transfer learning was used for pneumonia detection using the VGG and ResNet models, which allowed for faster and more accurate training by utilizing pre-trained weights from a larger dataset. For tuberculosis detection, the models were trained from scratch without transfer learning.

                            The best model was then used to classify X-rays into healthy, pneumonia, or tuberculosis categories. The project also included executing predictions on individual models for their designated functions.
                            
                            <br>To evaluate the performance of the models, the variability in the training and testing accuracies of all the mentioned models was analyzed on different train-test split ratios trained on different numbers of epochs. This analysis helped to identify the optimal training configuration for each model, and provided insights into the robustness of the models to variations in the training and testing data.
                            
                            <br>Skills and tools used in this project included data visualization, data preparation, model building and evaluation, OpenCV, Python, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn. These tools were used to clean and preprocess the data, train and evaluate the models, and visualize the results.
                            
                            <br>Overall, this project demonstrated the potential of CNNs for accurately detecting lung infections and diseases from X-ray images, and provided insights into the performance of different CNN architectures for this task. The results of this project could be useful in developing more accurate and efficient diagnostic tools for lung diseases.

                        <br> The next step is to preprocess the data for NLP. The data is cleaned by removing punctuations and converting all text to lowercase to ensure consistency. A CountVectorizer is used to extract features from the text by converting the text into a matrix of token counts. The data is then split into training and testing datasets to train the machine learning model.
                        
                        <br> The RandomForestClassifier is used as a machine learning model for training. The model is trained on the training dataset, and its performance is evaluated on the testing dataset. The accuracy score is used to measure the performance of the model, which achieved an accuracy of 84.12% over the test data.
                        
                        <br>The results of the project show that there is a relationship between news headlines and stock price shifts. The machine learning model is able to predict the stock price changes based on the news headlines, which has implications for investors and financial analysts. The project can inform investment decisions and aid in risk management.
                        
                        <br>In conclusion, this project utilized NLP techniques to analyze the relationship between world news headlines and stock price shifts. The project highlights the importance of data preprocessing and feature extraction for NLP tasks. The machine learning model's performance shows that there is a relationship between news headlines and stock price shifts, which has practical implications for investors and financial analysts.

                    <p><strong>Project Description:</strong><br>
                        The objective of the project was to assist an automobile company in entering new markets with their existing products and identifying the right group of new customers based on their behavior. <br>This was achieved by employing the process of clustering to group similar observations together based on their features.

The first step in the process involved preparing the data for clustering and gaining insights through data visualization. <br>Subsequently, three methods were used to determine the optimal value for k, which is the number of clusters. The silhouette, WCSS, and Calinski-Harabasz methods were employed to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of clustering by measuring the differences between clusters and their compactness.<br>

After determining the optimal value for k, the data was trained on k-means clustering, which is a popular method of clustering that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. <br>K-means clustering is a relatively simple and efficient algorithm that works well for large datasets with a large number of observations.

<br>The results of the clustering can enable the automobile company to perform segmented outreach and communication for different segments of customers, tailoring marketing strategies and communication to specific customer segments. <br>Clustering is a powerful technique for segmenting customers and identifying patterns in large datasets with various applications in marketing, finance, and healthcare. For instance, in marketing, clustering can be used to segment customers based on demographics, behavior, or other factors to personalize marketing campaigns and increase customer retention.

The dataset used in this project contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, and comprises 284,807 transactions, out of which only 492 are fraudulent, resulting in a highly imbalanced dataset where the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

                        <br>The input features of the dataset are numerical and have been obtained through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation. The transformed features are labeled as V1, V2, ..., V28, while the remaining features that have not undergone PCA transformation are Time and Amount. The Time feature captures the time elapsed in seconds between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset, while the Amount feature represents the monetary amount involved in each transaction.
                        
                        <br>The primary objective of this project is to detect fraudulent transactions in the dataset using different anomaly detection techniques and comparing their performance. Three different techniques have been used for this purpose: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). 
                        
                        <br>The results of the project show that the Isolation Forest algorithm outperforms the other two algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Specifically, the Isolation Forest algorithm detected 73 errors, which is less than the 97 errors detected by the LOF algorithm and significantly less than the 8516 errors detected by the SVM algorithm. Furthermore, the Isolation Forest algorithm achieved an accuracy rate of 99.74%, which is higher than the LOF accuracy rate of 99.65% and much higher than the SVM accuracy rate of 70.09%. 
                        
                        <br>When evaluating the detection rate of fraud cases, the Isolation Forest algorithm performed significantly better than the LOF algorithm, with a detection rate of 27% compared to LOF's detection rate of only 2%. The SVM algorithm was unable to detect any fraudulent transactions. 
                        
                        <br>Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of the Isolation Forest algorithm for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The results suggest that increasing the sample size or using deep learning algorithms could improve the accuracy further, but at the cost of increased computational expense. Furthermore, the use of complex anomaly detection models could potentially enhance the accuracy of fraud detection even further.

                    <p><strong>Project Description:</strong><br>
                        The main objective of this project was to create a deep learning model, specifically a CNN, that could accurately detect room occupancy based on environmental sensor data. The sensor data used included temperature, humidity, and Co2, which were collected by an IoT system consisting of three sensors placed in different locations with varying environmental conditions.

The data collected was stored in a file and used to train the CNN model to predict the "motion" feature, which indicates the presence of movement in proximity to the sensors. Keras, a popular deep learning framework, was used to implement and optimize the model's hyperparameters.

Once the model was developed and optimized, its performance was evaluated by analyzing various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The results were presented in a technical report, which included diagrams, plots, tables, and numerical data to help visualize and interpret the model's performance.

Overall, this project demonstrated the potential of using CNN models and environmental sensor data to detect room occupancy, which could have practical applications in areas such as building automation, energy management, and security systems.</p>

                    <p><strong>Project Description:</strong><br>
                        The goal of this project was to develop a deep learning model that could accurately classify car brands based on custom data. The model was built using a ResNet architecture and transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models that have been trained on large datasets. The pre-trained model was fine-tuned on the custom dataset to improve its accuracy and adapt it to the task at hand.

                        The dataset consisted of images of cars from different brands, which were preprocessed to ensure consistency and quality. The images were split into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.
                        
                        The ResNet model was implemented using Keras and optimized using techniques such as learning rate scheduling and early stopping to achieve the best possible results. The performance of the model was evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, and the results were presented in a technical report.
                        
                        To further improve the model's performance, data augmentation techniques were used to increase the diversity and size of the training dataset. This helped the model generalize better to new, unseen images.
                        
                        Overall, this project demonstrated the effectiveness of using ResNet and transfer learning techniques to develop a deep learning model for car brand classification on custom data. The model could have practical applications in areas such as automotive manufacturing, advertising, and marketing.
